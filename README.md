# Project Name: Nba-Salary-Predictor2
Predict Nba salaries using player statistics with Machine Learning.  Built with python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data processing, modeling, and visualization 


** Key Features: Predicts NBA player salaries based on hisorical performance and player attriubutes.
- Handles categorical data using OneHotEncoder.
- Uses Linear Regression for salary prediction and analysis.
- Provides insights into which player stats most influence salary.

- *** Tools & Libraries
- Python - Programming language
- Pandas - Data cleaning & manipulation
- NumPy - Numerical computations
- Scikit-Learn - Machine learning moderling, including: Linear Regression, OneHotEncoder, Train-test split, Model Evulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data vsiualization

- *** Key Steps
- Split dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regressipn model on player stats & features
- One platform shows clear dominance in overall watch time.

- * Insights:
- Player efficiency, points per game, and experience are strong predictors of salary
- Certain positions (Center, Point Guard) show significant variance in pay
- Teams and market size can also indirectly influence salary
